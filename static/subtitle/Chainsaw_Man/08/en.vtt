00:03.419 --> 00:05.472
Where is the key...?

00:06.250 --> 00:07.500
Found it.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.339
Ouch!

00:26.550 --> 00:28.000
Heck.

00:30.736 --> 00:31.951
Phew.

00:48.630 --> 00:49.920
Off.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.170
Tasty.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.436
Right, what do I need
to see Makima for?

02:10.379 --> 02:11.929
Never mind.

02:16.379 --> 02:17.643
Water...

02:17.915 --> 02:19.201
Water...

02:56.379 --> 02:59.210
Denji.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.036
Why are you at my place?

03:03.879 --> 03:06.794
Did I bring you here?

03:09.419 --> 03:13.171
I feel dizzy. What the hell?

03:15.169 --> 03:20.149
Oh right.
You love Makima, don't you?

03:21.050 --> 03:22.800
So dizzy...

03:23.378 --> 03:26.669
You shouldn't love her.

03:26.669 --> 03:29.129
Geez. And Aki too.

03:29.129 --> 03:31.649
Why's he got to act so shy?

03:31.649 --> 03:35.090
Hell... Moo...

03:35.090 --> 03:36.210
Cow.

04:08.919 --> 04:10.229
Let's do it.

05:38.060 --> 05:42.134
(Chainsaw Man)

05:48.250 --> 05:49.536
Do...

05:49.536 --> 05:52.038
Do what?

05:54.170 --> 05:55.918
Sex.

06:00.629 --> 06:01.591
Arms up.

06:11.339 --> 06:12.435
That's right.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.300
Good boy.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.937
Should I do this?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.379
Good boy.

06:17.379 --> 06:20.526
My first kiss was supposed
to be with Makima.

06:20.526 --> 06:21.209
That's right.

06:21.209 --> 06:23.528
But I gave it to a woman
with a mouth full of vomit.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.824
Do I really want my first time
to be taken by the same one?

06:31.536 --> 06:32.339
Yes!

06:39.920 --> 06:41.589
Good boy.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.677
Let's take these pants off, too.

07:00.190 --> 07:02.860
There's something in your pocket.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.740
A Chupa Chups?
It's dirty!

07:10.339 --> 07:11.319
Denji.

07:11.752 --> 07:12.812
Denji...

07:13.245 --> 07:16.588
Denji, are you okay?

07:16.589 --> 07:18.713
Want some fresh air?

07:29.293 --> 07:32.528
I bought nausea medicine
from the supermarket.

07:32.879 --> 07:35.016
Take it with water before bed.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.146
Makima, I...

07:41.250 --> 07:44.302
I had a crappy first kiss.

07:45.151 --> 07:48.747
Even if I kiss different women
from now on,

07:49.452 --> 07:52.458
I'll think of the taste of vomit

07:52.920 --> 07:55.620
every time I do it.

07:58.379 --> 08:00.125
Open your mouth.

08:11.302 --> 08:14.966
You probably won't ever
forget the taste of vomit.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.819
But don't worry.

08:18.589 --> 08:21.050
From now until your death,

08:21.050 --> 08:23.983
you'll experience
all kinds of first tastes.

08:23.983 --> 08:27.607
You won't have time to
remember the taste of vomit.

08:28.237 --> 08:32.240
So your first indirect kiss

08:32.418 --> 08:35.581
is the taste of a cola-flavored
Chupa Chups.

08:42.918 --> 08:44.672
Sorry, Pochita.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.590
I bet you wanted to do it, too.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.169
But...

08:49.169 --> 08:51.796
I want to save it for Makima.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.436
Until I kill Gun Devil.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.717
Until then, I...

09:06.879 --> 09:08.937
Morning, Denji.

09:12.710 --> 09:15.075
Feeling up to breakfast?

09:19.879 --> 09:22.990
Eating while looking down
at people is the best.

09:23.590 --> 09:24.960
Denji.

09:25.549 --> 09:29.764
I got so drunk last night,
I don't remember a thing.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.842
Did I do anything to you?

09:32.842 --> 09:35.250
Like I'd do it with a vomit lady.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.157
I decided my first time's
gonna be with Makima.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.549
Thank god.

09:42.549 --> 09:46.409
I'd get arrested if I made
a move on a minor.

09:56.741 --> 09:59.169
You are strange, Denji.

09:59.169 --> 10:02.914
Most people would get
uncomfortable and leave now.

10:04.210 --> 10:06.961
Why would I leave
when I can get free food?

10:08.549 --> 10:11.215
So, Denji, you like Makima, too?

10:11.215 --> 10:12.591
Yes, I do.

10:13.460 --> 10:16.470
Even if she's got a crappy personality?

10:16.470 --> 10:17.471
Yes.

10:21.919 --> 10:22.960
Okay, then.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.187
I'll set you up with her.

10:26.879 --> 10:28.274
Really?

10:28.274 --> 10:29.590
Yes.

10:29.590 --> 10:33.445
Denji, how about we
form a secret alliance?

10:33.445 --> 10:36.799
I'll help you get with Makima.

10:36.799 --> 10:38.902
And you help me with Aki.

10:47.549 --> 10:49.168
What do you like about that guy?

10:49.168 --> 10:50.169
His face.

10:53.379 --> 10:55.870
All right, I'm in.

10:55.870 --> 10:57.970
Let's do this alliance.

10:58.629 --> 11:02.629
So, we are no longer
senior and junior from now.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.393
Let's be friends.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.460
Come over for breakfast once in a while.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.883
And bring that Fiend and Aki.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.129
Do you think Makima would come, too?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.355
When will we arrive in Kyoto again?

11:38.049 --> 11:39.500
In 30 minutes.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.889
I'll buy a boxed meal, then.

11:41.889 --> 11:44.379
You have a luncheon at one, miss.

11:44.379 --> 11:47.519
I'll make room by, then.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.590
I don't really want to meet
with the Kyoto bigwigs.

11:52.590 --> 11:54.210
They are all so scary.

11:54.750 --> 11:58.188
I'd rather have my lunch
in a relaxed mood.

11:59.799 --> 12:03.081
The drinks yesterday were delicious.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.479
This is Team C...

12:39.668 --> 12:40.710
This is Team C...

12:40.710 --> 12:41.669
Commence operation.

13:44.340 --> 13:46.419
What's that noise?

13:46.419 --> 13:48.629
You don't know?
How dumb!

13:48.629 --> 13:50.340
It's the sound of Taiko drums.

13:50.340 --> 13:51.460
Is there a festival?

13:51.460 --> 13:52.629
Oh right.

13:52.629 --> 13:55.480
You two really didn't mate last night?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.692
Denji is actually a gentleman.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.879
I can't believe you can
eat the ramen here.

14:04.879 --> 14:06.616
Doesn't it taste terrible?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.370
Who are you?

14:11.370 --> 14:13.624
Tastes fine to me!

14:13.624 --> 14:15.840
Don't speak to me as if you know me!

14:16.419 --> 14:19.085
I see you can't judge
the quality of food.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.879
You can't help it, though.

14:21.879 --> 14:25.090
It's said that if you only eat
the same thing in your childhood,

14:25.090 --> 14:27.419
your palate will be
unrefined as an adult.

14:28.629 --> 14:31.460
And an unrefined palate
lowers your happiness.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.419
I'm very happy!

14:33.419 --> 14:34.750
Let's go.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.340
My grandpa was the
kindest man in the world.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.340
He brought me to fancy
restaurants all the time.

14:42.402 --> 14:46.413
He was yakuza, but he had principles.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.799
You might call people like him

14:49.669 --> 14:51.662
a necessary evil.

14:51.662 --> 14:55.549
He's only killed a few
women and children.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.907
He'd buy me anything I wanted
with the drug money.

15:00.796 --> 15:03.299
He was a good man

15:03.299 --> 15:05.759
whom everybody loved.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.873
You loved him too, right, Denji?

15:12.265 --> 15:14.710
What are you getting at?

15:14.710 --> 15:15.894
Do you know him?

15:15.894 --> 15:19.565
Gun Devil wants your heart.

15:30.158 --> 15:30.993
Samurai Head!

15:30.993 --> 15:32.049
Kon!

15:50.379 --> 15:51.889
Aki Hayakawa...

15:52.669 --> 15:56.503
You put something monstrous
in my mouth.

15:57.669 --> 15:58.895
It's neither human

15:58.895 --> 16:00.710
not devil...

16:14.879 --> 16:17.623
Power. Stop Senior Himeno's bleeding.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.169
A nail?

16:28.340 --> 16:29.384
Fire!

16:31.886 --> 16:32.888
Three.

16:46.235 --> 16:47.027
Fire!

16:48.361 --> 16:49.629
Two.

16:55.744 --> 16:56.370
Fire!

16:58.799 --> 16:59.581
One.

17:03.879 --> 17:05.836
I've had enough of that creepy thing.

17:05.836 --> 17:07.923
Curse! Kill him!

17:08.163 --> 17:09.674
Zero.

17:38.130 --> 17:39.638
How's Senior Himeno?

17:40.663 --> 17:43.125
We'd better take her to a doctor now.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.001
That guy...

17:45.009 --> 17:47.393
He had a gun.

17:47.753 --> 17:50.549
But only police officers
and Devil Hunters

17:50.549 --> 17:52.392
can obtain guns in Japan.

17:53.175 --> 17:57.221
Gun Devil wants your heart.

17:59.088 --> 18:01.634
We should get Senior Himeno
medical treatment first.

18:01.635 --> 18:02.799
Your Curse Devil.

18:03.799 --> 18:06.839
Run that nail through someone
enough times and they'll die.

18:06.839 --> 18:08.170
Am I right?

18:08.692 --> 18:11.468
Nice moves on your part.

18:12.089 --> 18:13.446
Where did you come from?

18:13.446 --> 18:15.301
Are you with him?

18:33.967 --> 18:36.089
How did you lose?

18:36.089 --> 18:39.210
I had my guard down.
I really had my guard down.

18:39.215 --> 18:40.894
Well, kill him, then.

19:14.799 --> 19:16.425
He's still alive.

19:16.425 --> 19:20.048
The Devil Hunters' suits are sturdy.

19:20.049 --> 19:20.931
Finish him off.

19:23.224 --> 19:26.630
Leave me. Go save Aki.

19:26.630 --> 19:27.920
No way.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.549
I can't even see his moves.

19:31.589 --> 19:32.483
Ghost...

19:33.710 --> 19:34.986
I refuse.

19:34.986 --> 19:37.670
That girl is scary.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.343
I will give you all of me.

19:59.089 --> 20:02.023
So let me use all of you.

20:22.299 --> 20:25.114
Aki can cry.

20:28.914 --> 20:33.210
Devil hunters get so used to death

20:33.210 --> 20:35.101
that they eventually stop crying.

20:36.381 --> 20:38.307
But Aki cries very often.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.179
When his newbies died,

20:42.179 --> 20:44.946
he'd hide away and cry.
It's very interesting.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.130
It must be a really good feeling

20:51.619 --> 20:53.315
to have someone care and cry for you.

21:01.236 --> 21:03.200
Hey! Help me!

21:24.130 --> 21:25.834
Aki...

21:25.834 --> 21:27.210
Don't die.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.741
When I die...

21:37.170 --> 21:38.920
I hope you can cry for me.

21:40.153 --> 21:41.695
Snake, swallow it.

21:53.799 --> 21:54.584
Return.
